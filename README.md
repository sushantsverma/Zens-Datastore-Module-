# Zens-Datastore-Module-
This repository contains the datastore module made by Zen for Roblox. It is work in progress and very easy to understand and use.

This is an open-sourced Datastore module. [WIP]

The GET method uses 3 parameters. "plr" refers to the Local player, "dataStore" refers to the desired Data Store you're going
to be using, and "dataStoreKey" refers to the key in which you want to save the data to (preferably player's UserId).

The SET method uses 4 parameters. The parameters are the same as the GET method with one addition being "dataToSave". This parameter refers to the data that you want to save to the specific key.

Note: The data that you're saving will be converted into a table no matter it's original datatype for simplicity. This is done by the module.

*Specific instructions have been given inside the functions where needed.*

# Further features will be added upon updates.
